# Annika's react-boilerplate

This is a base for starting new projects using React, Webpack, Babel on an Express server. 

# Setup

After cloning this repo

```sh
cd react-boilerplate 
yarn
yarn dev
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000] and see the page. Any change to the server will cause a restart and any change to client code will rebuild `bundle.js`.

`BOOM`
